# NBA Weight Analysis and Statistical Methods

This repository contains an analysis of NBA player weights, with a focus on applying various statistical methods. The analysis involves visualizing the distribution of player weights, calculating sample means, and performing hypothesis testing. Additionally, the repository demonstrates how to apply binomial distribution and calculate expected values in probability theory.

## Project Overview

The project explores NBA player weight data using statistical methods, including:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Understanding the distribution of weights and calculating the population mean and standard deviation.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing whether a newly selected NBA team has a significantly different average weight compared to a population mean.
- **Sampling & Confidence Intervals:** Drawing random samples, calculating sample means, and constructing confidence intervals.
- **Probability Theory:** Implementing binomial distribution and calculating expected values in various scenarios.

## Files Included

Analysis Details
Weight Distribution:

The distribution of NBA player weights is visualized using a histogram.
Population mean and standard deviation of weights are calculated.
Sampling and Confidence Intervals:

Random samples of NBA player weights are taken, and their sample means are computed.
A confidence interval for the mean weight of a new team is calculated using a z-test.
Hypothesis Testing:

A hypothesis test is conducted to check whether a new team has a mean weight significantly different from 220 pounds.
Binomial Distribution:

Various binomial distribution problems are explored and visualized, demonstrating the probability of specific outcomes in a set of independent trials.
Expected Value Calculation:

Expected value calculations are performed using binomial probability mass functions for random variables.
Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the application of various statistical methods to real-world data, providing insights into NBA player weight distributions, sampling methods, hypothesis testing, and probability theory. The project is a useful example for those interested in data analysis, statistical inference, and probability theory.
